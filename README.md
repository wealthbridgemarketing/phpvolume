It truly is very easy to start building applications right away with phpVolume.

If you can populate data in an array, you can build amazing business applications.

With your array (aka application object), phpVolume automatically creates the form based on the information you give it.  The form can load with the page or via ajax and can be saved via post or ajax. It's as easy as updating a value in the array.  Even with all of it's automation, it will never get in your way as a programmer.  Easily extend any of the built in functionality with an easy to use system of built in hooks.

Don't let it's automation fool you. The system will never get it your way. The underlying architecture is at your disposal and gives you unyielding creation power.  You can create anything you can dream of with phpVolume, no matter how complex.

Advanced security is provided with the Sentry security suite built specifically for phpVolume.  It has 3 levels of entities called Networks, Accounts and Users.  There are three types of permissions, system, filepath and virtual.  Permission can be given to higher level entities and inherited by the lower tiers.  Filepath permissions use an octal allowing you to specify Create, Read, Update and Delete permissions.  Virtual permissions allow you to protect anything.  Create user roles to define permission groups.  Roles are recurrsive and can contain other other roles.

The integrated DataGrid allows you to turn any sql statement into a datagrid.  It features customizable data filters that allow comparison operators, user defined page size, sortable columns, unlimited links and tons more.

It comes with a professionally built theme that's easy to setup for new clients.  Simply change the colors, logo and favicon and you're done.  Each Network can have a different theme.  This is each to achieve using child themes that allow you to replace on the parts of the base them that are necessary for the new look.  Typically that's a logo, color scheme and favicon.  You're always free to build completely new themes for clients as well.

It utilizes the ADOdb database layer that supports over 20 different databases including MySQL, MS SQL and Oracle. A MySQL database is provided with the installation.  If you don't know ADOdb it's easy to learn.  Execute(), Fields(), RecordCount() and Insert_ID() are what's used about 99% of the time.  phpVolume can easily connect to multiple databases.  Or define multiple databases and use the database function library to easily connect and disconnect to the other databases at will.

The phpVolume Framework is extremely powerful and provides a lot of extremely powerful features such as lazy loading of classes and function libraries, exception handling, error log management, port switching, debugging and much, much more.  There is a single configuration file for the entire system that allows you to specify settings for each machine that the platform is to be run on including all development machines, testing and production.

The system is extremely fast and has a very small footprint.  The built in performance profiler will give you exact details of the resources it uses on your system.  It's been tuned for blazing speed and will suprise you with how quickly it works.
